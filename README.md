One day I wanted to watch “Lost: Missing Pieces” a series of thirteen video clips ranging in length from one to four minutes but I faced a problem which was that I could only find a video (about 30 min) has all the 13 video clips but for the subtitle files there were 13 files, one for every episode, and because of that the subtitle files were worthless so I made this program to edit and merge them into one file and also put some delay between every two consecutive files.
In "subtitles" file you'll find the 13 subtitle files that the program will edit and delay and then it'll merge them into one file called "AllInSub"
